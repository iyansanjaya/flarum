[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/charescape/serialize-closure/v/stable.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/charescape/serialize-closure)
[![Latest Unstable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/charescape/serialize-closure/v/unstable.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/charescape/serialize-closure)

# Differences compared to the original version

- Installs as a replacement of [opis/closure](https://github.com/opis/closure) package, 
uses the same namespaces and classes
```bash
 composer require charescape/serialize-closure
```

_If you require `opis/closure` directly in your root composer.json, you have to remove it first_
```bash
composer remove opis/closure
```
- Added support for PHP 8.0, 8.1, 8.2
- Fixed deprecations:
  - [PHP 8.1: Serializable interface deprecated](https://php.watch/versions/8.1/serializable-deprecated)
  - [PHP 8.2: Dynamic Properties are deprecated](https://php.watch/versions/8.2/dynamic-properties-deprecated)

### Backward incompatible changes

##### 1. Serialization format and `SerializableClosure` class API

> **TLDR:** You are affected ONLY if you either:
> - Used `JsonSerializableClosure`
> - Signed closures with `SerializableClosure::setSecretKey()`
> - Extended `SerializableClosure` or `JsonSerializableClosure` classes

The [PHP 8.1: Serializable interface deprecation](https://php.watch/versions/8.1/serializable-deprecated)
forces us to implement the `__serialize(): array` and `__unserialize(array $data): void` methods.

Since PHP 7.4, when a class gets these magic methods implemented, the `Serializable::serialize(): string` 
and `Serialize::unserialize(): void` are not called anymore. Check out the following example, to understand
how the output looks [with](https://3v4l.org/JmIRQ) and [without](https://3v4l.org/Tp4UF)
the `__serialize` and `__unserialize` methods implemented.

It means we can only build the data array we want PHP to serialize to a string, but we can't build the string
ourselves to include a signature there. This is why we had to change the serialization format for 
the `JsonSerializableClosure` class and the `SerializableClosure` when signature verification is enabled.

Action points, if you are affected:
1. If you have serialized closures saved in your database, caches or files â€“ you will need to re-serialize them.
2. If you have extended `SerializableClosure` or `JsonSerializableClosure` classes, you will need to review
your code and make the necessary changes.

Serializable closures
---------------------
**Opis Closure** is a library that aims to overcome PHP's limitations regarding closure
serialization by providing a wrapper that will make all closures serializable. 

**The library's key features:**

- Serialize any closure
- Serialize arbitrary objects
- Doesn't use `eval` for closure serialization or unserialization
- Works with any PHP version that has support for closures
- Supports PHP 7 syntax
- Handles all variables referenced/imported in `use()` and automatically wraps all referenced/imported closures for
proper serialization
- Handles recursive closures
- Handles magic constants like `__FILE__`, `__DIR__`, `__LINE__`, `__NAMESPACE__`, `__CLASS__`,
`__TRAIT__`, `__METHOD__` and `__FUNCTION__`.
- Automatically resolves all class names, function names and constant names used inside the closure
- Track closure's residing source by using the `#trackme` directive
- Simple and very fast parser
- Any error or exception, that might occur when executing an unserialized closure, can be caught and treated properly
- You can serialize/unserialize any closure unlimited times, even those previously unserialized
(this is possible because `eval()` is not used for unserialization)
- Handles static closures
- Supports cryptographically signed closures
- Provides a reflector that can give you information about the serialized closure
- Provides an analyzer for *SuperClosure* library
- Automatically detects when the scope and/or the bound object of a closure needs to be serialized
in order for the closure to work after deserialization

## Documentation

The full documentation for this library can be found [here][documentation].

## License

**Opis Closure** is licensed under the [MIT License (MIT)][license].

## Requirements

* PHP ^5.4 || ^7.0 || ^8.0

## Installation

**Opis Closure** is available on [Packagist] and it can be installed from a 
command line interface by using [Composer]. 

```bash
composer require opis/closure
```

Or you could directly reference it into your `composer.json` file as a dependency

```json
{
    "require": {
        "opis/closure": "^3.5"
    }
}
```

### Migrating from 2.x

If your project needs to support PHP 5.3 you can continue using the `2.x` version
of **Opis Closure**. Otherwise, assuming you are not using one of the removed/refactored classes or features(see 
[CHANGELOG]), migrating to version `3.x` is simply a matter of updating your `composer.json` file. 

### Semantic versioning

**Opis Closure** follows [semantic versioning][SemVer] specifications.

### Arbitrary object serialization

We've added this feature in order to be able to support the serialization of a closure's bound object. 
The implementation is far from being perfect, and it's really hard to make it work flawless. 
We will try to improve this, but we can't guarantee anything. 
So our advice regarding the `Opis\Closure\serialize|unserialize` functions is to use them with caution.
